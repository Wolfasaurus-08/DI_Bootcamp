# Daily Challenge: Dictionaries
# Last Updated: December 25th, 2023

# What You will learn :
# Python Basics, Dictionaries
# Conditionals
# Loops


# Instructions
# Challenge 1
# Ask a user for a word
# # Write a program that creates a dictionary. This dictionary stores the indexes of each letter in a list.
valuelst=[]
word_dict = {}
word = input("pick word ")
for i, letter in enumerate(word):
    if letter in word_dict:
        word_dict[letter].append(i)
    else:
        #print('else','i',i, 'letter',letter)
        word_dict[letter] = [i]
    
print (word_dict)


# Make sure the letters are the keys.
# Make sure the letters are strings.
# Make sure the indexes are stored in a list and those lists are values.
# Examples

# "dodo" ➞ { "d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3] }

# "froggy" ➞ { "f":  [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5] }

# "grapes" ➞ { "g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3]}


# Challenge 2
# Create a program that prints a list of the items you can afford in the store with the money you have in your wallet.
# Sort the list in alphabetical order.
# Return “Nothing” if you can’t afford anything from the store.
# Hint : make sure to convert the amount from dollars to numbers. Create a program that deletes the $ sign, and the comma (for thousands)

# Examples

# The key is the product, the value is the price

# items_purchase = {
#   "Water": "$1",
#   "Bread": "$3",
#   "TV": "$1,000",
#   "Fertilizer": "$20"
# }

# wallet = "$300"

# ➞ ["Bread", "Fertilizer", "Water"]

# items_purchase = {
#   "Apple": "$4",
#   "Honey": "$3",
#   "Fan": "$14",
#   "Bananas": "$4",
#   "Pan": "$100",
#   "Spoon": "$2"
# }

# wallet = "$100" 

# ➞ ["Apple", "Bananas", "Fan", "Honey", "Spoon"]

# # In fact the prices of Apple + Honey + Fan + Bananas + Pan is more that $100, so you cannot by the Pan, 
# # instead you can by the Spoon that is $2

# items_purchase = {
#   "Phone": "$999",
#   "Speakers": "$300",
#   "Laptop": "$5,000",
#   "PC": "$1200"
# }

# wallet = "$1" 

# ➞ "Nothing"
